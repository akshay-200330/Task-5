# 🚢 Titanic EDA - Data Analyst Internship Task

## 🔍 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Rows**: 418 passengers
- **Features**: Passenger details including class, fare, age, sex, etc.
- **Target**: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

### 🧪 Key Explorations
- Age and Fare distribution (Histograms)
- Survival rates by Gender and Class (Bar plots)
- Age by Class (Boxplot)
- Correlation Heatmap

### 💡 Observations
- Females had a higher chance of survival.
- First class passengers had better survival rates.
- Fare and Survival have a positive correlation.

### 📁 Files Included
- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code and visuals
- `titanic_eda_summary.png` – Summary visualization image
- `titanic_eda_report.pdf` – PDF report of findings
- `tested.csv` – Dataset used

### ✅ Tools Used
